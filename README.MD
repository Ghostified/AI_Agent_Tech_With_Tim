Simple AI Agent:

Here is the detailed sequence diagram for the provided code:Explanation:

1. The user initiates a request to the agent, asking "What is the capital of France?" and providing their name "Alice".

2. The agent invokes the language model (LLM) with the user's query and name as input parameters.

3. The LLM generates a raw response to the agent's request.

4. The agent passes the raw response to the parser, which is responsible for parsing the response and creating a structured ResearchResponse object.

5. The parser creates the ResearchResponse object and returns it to the agent.

6. The agent then returns the structured response to the user.

The key interactions in this sequence diagram are:

The user initiating the request to the agent
The agent invoking the LLM to generate a raw response
The agent passing the raw response to the parser to create a structured response
The parser creating the ResearchResponse object
The agent returning the structured response to the user
The diagram also includes the relevant participants (User, Agent, LLM, Parser, and ResearchResponse) and their interactions, as well as the function calls and parameter details.
